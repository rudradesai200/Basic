# BASIC : An automated tool for hassle-free Django project setup
'Basic' is a complete package for the advanced setup of the Django-Python framework. Setup of most of the features including and not limited to template tags, Django-admin custom commands, include and templating in Django are covered. Just install this package, run the setup script, and then use it to have your own preconfigured advanced Django project with just a few commands. 

Also, add as many apps you want, with no additional configuration to be done. Everything like adding URLs, including that app to INCLUDED_APPS, setting up the basic index page, and many more, is done automatically. Please look at the examples below to get started.
